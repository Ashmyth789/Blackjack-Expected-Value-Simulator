# Blackjack-Expected-Value-Simulator
This project models probabilistic decision-making under uncertainty using Monte Carlo simulation of Blackjack.
It compares:
- Random decision strategy
- Basic strategy (rule-based near-optimal play)

The objective is to analyze long-term profitability using expected value and variance dynamics.
